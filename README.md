# Recipe Finder

## About

You can find recipes from around a world with this React app. It uses the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to searching for recipes. When the recipes are found they are listed below the search bar. When you click on one of the listed recipes a modal opens with the food's ingredients and the cooking instructions. You can close the modal to click besides it. I used SASS for the styling, and the *Dosis* and *Righteous* fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

If you'd like to run the application locally clone the repository, run `npm install` and then run `npm start`.
